  "body": "### Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning Repository\r\nMy research is on Reinforcement Learning.\r\n\r\n### What is reinforcement learning?\r\nIn short, RL is an attempt to enable computers to learn *sequential decision makings* through *experience*. Think about *Tic-tac-toe* game, for example. There is a 3-by-3 grid and at each turn one of the two players puts a mark (X for player 1 and O for player 2) on one of the squares. Winner is the one who can have three marks on a row, column, or diagonal. (X is the winner in the following example!)\r\n\r\n     X | O | O\r\n    -----------\r\n     O | X |\r\n    -----------\r\n     X |   | X\r\n\r\nTie-tac-toe is an instance of sequential decision making. You make decisions one at a time and wait for your opponent's move (or wait until something changes in the environment) and then decide on the next move. Reinforcement Learning tries to teach computers to learn how to play without teaching them how to play!\r\n\r\n### What have I done so far?\r\nIn any RL project, you should have a learner (*agent*) who does something and learns how to do better, something like a game (*subject*) to teach to the learner, and a mean to connect the learner to the subject (*environment*). So far, I managed to implement three modules in Python to do these tasks. They are called (as you might guess): `environments`, `agents`, and `subjects`. (There is also `valueset` which is internal to the implementation).\r\n\r\n### Any success in Learning?!\r\nYes! My QAgent (which is an implementation of Q-learning algorithm) learned to play Tic-tac-toe and beat me!\r\n\r\nWhat else?\r\nNow I have `MNKGame` which the extended version of tic-tac-toe, `Snake` which is the good old snake game (I used some online code and modified it). I also have `ANNAgent`, which uses *neural networks*, but it's not working yet!\r\n\r\nHow can I collaborate?\r\nJust email me via sadjad-anzabizadeh@uiowa.edu or sadjad.anzabizadeh@gmail.com to see how we can collaborate.",
