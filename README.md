# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains my codes for a Reinforcement Learning system.
There are three main components (classes) in this code:
1. Environment, that governs other two components
2. Subject, which is a set of classes that simulate different games or learning situations
3. Agent, which is a set of classes that implement different agents including RLAgent, RandomAgent, and UserAgent
